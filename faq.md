### Enrolling 

1. **Q:** Can you give a permission code to enroll? **A:** We (instructors or course staff) cannot issue permission codes, you will need to fill in the online application at the college website, non-obvious cases will come to us.

2. **Q** I don't satisfy the ANU pre-requisite requirements but I would still like to enroll (and I have evidence showing that I can handle this course).  **A:** See response to item 1. You will need fill in the above form attaching the evidence. Such as: academic transcript, syllabus of related courses from another university, narratives about related programming or math experience. 
 
4. **Q:** What is the difference between SML (COMP4670/8600) and IML (COMP3670/6670)? Which one should I take?  **A:** IML is a pre-requisite of SML. IML uses the "[MML](https://mml-book.github.io/)" book whereas SML uses the "[PRML](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/cmbishop/prml-book/)" book. Both courses cover ~ 50%+ of the chapters. Have a look at the books to get a feel of the level of the class.  
 
5. **Q:** Why is SML (COMP4670/8600) NOT a pre-requisite for AML (COMP4680)  **A:** SML is a broad-but-thorough course that aims to cover most fundational topics in machine learning, whereas AML specialises in one or more sub-topics in machine learning. In recent years AML has covered covex optimisation, optimisation in ML, and other topics. In fact, AML's pre-requisite is **IML OR SML**. 


### Studying

7. **Q:** What programming language do we use in SML? **A:** Python 3.x, with both jupyter notebook and .py files.
